/**
 * A container for all tag libraries that are defined "globally"
 * for the web application.
 * <p/>
 * Tag Libraries can be defined globally in one of two ways:
 * 1. Via <taglib> elements in web.xml:
 * the uri and location of the tag-library are specified in
 * the <taglib> element.
 * 2. Via packaged jar files that contain .tld files
 * within the META-INF directory, or some subdirectory
 * of it. The taglib is 'global' if it has the <uri>
 * element defined.
 * <p/>
 * A mapping between the taglib URI and its associated TaglibraryInfoImpl
 * is maintained in this container.
 * Actually, that's what we'd like to do. However, because of the
 * way the classes TagLibraryInfo and TagInfo have been defined,
 * it is not currently possible to share an instance of TagLibraryInfo
 * across page invocations. A bug has been submitted to the spec lead.
 * In the mean time, all we do is save the 'location' where the
 * TLD associated with a taglib URI can be found.
 * <p/>
 * When a JSP page has a taglib directive, the mappings in this container
 * are first searched (see method getLocation()).
 * If a mapping is found, then the location of the TLD is returned.
 * If no mapping is found, then the uri specified
 * in the taglib directive is to be interpreted as the location for
 * the TLD of this tag library.
